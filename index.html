        <h3>Short intro</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Warren Edward Buffett (/ˈbʌfɪt/ BUFF-itt; born August 30, 1930)[2] is
          an American investor, business tycoon, philanthropist, and the
          chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is considered one of the
          most successful investors in the world[3][4] and has a net worth of
          over $100.6 billion as of April 2021,[1] making him the world's
          seventh-wealthiest person.[1]

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated to
          schoolboy days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional stock
          brokerage near his father's own brokerage office. On a trip to New
          York City at age ten, he made a point to visit the New York Stock
          Exchange. At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred
          for himself, and three for his sister Doris Buffett (who also became a
          philanthropist).[21][22][23] At 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly
          delivering Washington Post newspapers. In high school, he invested in
          a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a
          tenant farmer. He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200
          of his savings. By the time he finished college, Buffett had
          accumulated $9,800 in savings (about $105,000 today).[20][24]

        <h3>Investment career</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships,
          which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over
          $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one.
          Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile
          manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway. He began buying shares in
          Berkshire from Seabury Stanton, the owner, whom he later fired.
          Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In
          1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire
          aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working
          capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed
          assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire
          Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to
          run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money.
          He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst
          trade.[41] He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and,
          in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of
          Berkshire Hathaway was sold. In a second letter, Buffett announced his
          first investment in a private business — Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a
          privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid
          out its first and only dividend of 10 cents.[42] In 1969, Buffett
          liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his
          partners including shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, Buffett
          began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. He lived
          solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment
          income. In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the Washington
          Post Company. Buffett became close friends with Katharine Graham, who
          controlled the company and its flagship newspaper and joined its
          board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and
          Berkshire's acquisition of Wesco Financial, due to possible conflict
          of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly
          purchased the Buffalo Evening News for $32.5 million. Antitrust
          charges started, instigated by its rival, the Buffalo Courier-Express.
          Both papers lost money until the Courier-Express folded in 1982. In
          1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. Capital Cities
          announced a $3.5 billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985, surprising
          the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities
          at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake
          in the combined company.[43] The newly merged company, known as
          Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some
          stations due to U.S. Federal Communications Commission ownership
          rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same
          markets.[44] In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in
          Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a
          director. In 1990, a scandal involving John Gutfreund (former CEO of
          Salomon Brothers) surfaced. A rogue trader, Paul Mozer, was submitting
          bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was
          brought to Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the
          rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.[45] Buffett
          became Chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed.[46] In 1988,
          Buffett began buying The Coca-Cola Company stock, eventually
          purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02 billion.[47] It would
          turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments, and one
          which it still holds.[48]

        <h3>Investment Policy</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Warren Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various
          articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators[91] as a great
          story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He
          has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:[92] The
          arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax
          than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation
          tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no
          difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account
          whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during
          a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5
          percent inflation. — Buffett, Fortune (1977) In his article, "The
          Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville", Buffett rebutted the
          academic efficient-market hypothesis, that beating the S&P 500 was
          "pure chance", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of
          students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought. In
          addition to himself, Buffett named Walter J. Schloss, Tom Knapp, Ed
          Anderson (Tweedy, Browne LLC), William J. Ruane (Sequoia Fund),
          Charlie Munger (Buffett's partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific
          Partners Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments).[93] In his
          November 1999 Fortune article, he warned of investors' unrealistic
          expectations:[94] Let me summarize what I've been saying about the
          stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case
          that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything
          like—anything like—they've performed in the past 17. If I had to pick
          the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined,
          that investors in aggregate—repeat, aggregate—would earn in a world of
          constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful
          frictional costs, it would be 6%! — Buffett, Fortune (1999)

            In 1949, Buffett was infatuated with a young woman whose boyfriend
            had a ukulele. In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the
            instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt
            was unsuccessful, his music interest was a key part of his becoming
            a part of Susan Thompson's life and led to their marriage. Buffett
            often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other
            opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning
            of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was
            auctioned for charity.[96] Buffett married Susan Buffett (born
            Thompson) in 1952. They had three children, Susie, Howard and Peter.
            The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained
            married until Susan Buffett's death in July 2004. Their daughter,
            Susie, lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc.,
            and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett
            Foundation.[97] In 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his
            longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old—she had
            lived with him since his wife's departure to San Francisco in
            1977.[98][99] Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left
            Omaha to pursue her singing career. All three were close and
            Christmas cards to friends were signed "Warren, Susie and
            Astrid".[100] Susan briefly discussed this relationship in an
            interview on the Charlie Rose Show shortly before her death, in a
            rare glimpse into Buffett's personal life.[101] Buffett disowned his
            son Peter's adopted daughter, Nicole, in 2006 after she participated
            in the Jamie Johnson documentary The One Percent about the growing
            economic inequality between the wealthy and the average citizen in
            the United States. Although his first wife referred to Nicole as one
            of her "adored grandchildren",[102] Buffett wrote her a letter
            stating, "I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a
            grandchild, nor have the rest of my family adopted you as a niece or
            a cousin."[103][104][105] His 2006 annual salary was about $100,000,
            which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in
            comparable companies.[106] In 2008, he earned a total compensation
            of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000.[107] He
            continued to live in the same house in the central Dundee
            neighborhood of Omaha that he bought in 1958 for $31,500, a fraction
            of today's value. He also owns a $4 million house in Laguna Beach,
            California.[108] In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7 million of
            Berkshire's funds on a private jet, Buffett named it "The
            Indefensible". This act was a break from his past condemnation of
            extravagant purchases by other CEOs and his history of using more
            public transportation.[109] Bridge is such a sensational game that I
            wouldn't mind being in jail if I had three cellmates who were decent
            players and who were willing to keep the game going twenty-four
            hours a day. —Buffett on bridge[110] Buffett is an avid bridge
            player, which he plays with fellow fan Gates[111]—he allegedly
            spends 12 hours a week playing the game.[112] In 2006, he sponsored
            a bridge match for the Buffett Cup. Modeled on the Ryder Cup in
            golf—held immediately before it in the same city—the teams are
            chosen by invitation, with a female team and five male teams
            provided by each country.[113] He is a dedicated, lifelong follower
            of Nebraska football, and attends as many games as his schedule
            permits. He supported the hire of Bo Pelini, following the 2007
            season, stating, "It was getting kind of desperate around
            here".[114] He watched the 2009 game against Oklahoma from the
            Nebraska sideline, after being named an honorary assistant
            coach.[115] Buffett worked with Christopher Webber on an animated
            series called "Secret Millionaires Club" with chief Andy Heyward of
            DiC Entertainment. The series features Buffett and Munger and
            teaches children healthy financial habits.[116][117] Buffett was
            raised as a Presbyterian, but has since described himself as
            agnostic.[118] In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett did
            not carry a mobile phone, did not have a computer at his desk, and
            drove his own automobile,[119] a Cadillac DTS.[120] In contrast to
            that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, he
            stated he uses Google as his preferred search engine.[121] In 2013
            he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire
            life.[122] In February 2020, Buffett revealed in a CNBC interview
            that he had traded in his flip phone for an iPhone 11.[123] Buffett
            reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the Omaha World
            Herald, which his company acquired in 2011. Buffett's speeches are
            known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett
            presides over Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in the
            Qwest Center in Omaha, Nebraska, an event drawing over 20,000
            visitors from both the Uni
